        return transportation != null;
    }
} [/INST]  Yes, there is a code issue of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" in the `TransportationService` class.

In the `checkIfTransportationExists` method, the `Transportation` entity is fetched using the `findById` method, and then the `orElse` method is used to return `null` if the entity is not found. However, this approach has a performance issue because it fetches the whole entity, even though we only need to check if the entity exists.

A better approach would be to use the `existsById` method provided by the `JpaRepository` interface, which returns a `boolean` value indicating whether the entity exists or not. This approach avoids fetching the whole entity, which can improve performance.

Here's an example of how the `checkIfTransportationExists` method could be rewritten using the `existsById` method:
```
@Transactional
public boolean checkIfTransportationExists(Long id) {
    return transportationRepository.existsById(id);
}
```

} [/INST]  Yes, there is a code issue of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" in the `PatientService` class.

In the `isPatientExists` method, the `Patient` entity is fetched from the database using the `findByPatientId` method, and then the `patient` variable is checked for nullity. This is an example of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" because the entire `Patient` entity is fetched from the database, even though only the `patientId` field is needed to check if the patient exists.

To fix this issue, the `Patient` entity could be fetched using the `findById` method, which would only retrieve the `patientId` field, and then the `patient` variable could be checked for nullity. This would be more efficient and reduce the amount of data being transferred between the client and the server.

The method fetches the entire user entity with `userRepo.findById(userId)`, which is unnecessary and inefficient. Instead, the method should use `userRepo.existsById(userId)` to check if the user exists without fetching the entire entity. This will reduce the number of database queries and improve the performance of the method.

The issue is that the method fetches the whole entity using `findById` and then checks if it is present. This is not necessary, as the `deleteById` method already checks if the entity exists before deleting it.

Instead of fetching the whole entity, the method should use `deleteById` directly, like this:
```

This approach is more efficient and avoids the unnecessary overhead of fetching the whole entity.

The code fetches the whole entity using `findAllByGroupCode` and then checks if the collection is empty or not. If the collection is not empty, it returns the first element's ID. This approach is not considered an issue of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" because it is not fetching the whole entity just to check its existence.

 [/INST]  Yes, there is a code issue of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" in the `updateOpenIDConnectClientVerifiedStatus` method.

The method fetches the entire `OAuthClient` entity for the given `clientId` using `oauthClientDao.selectOAuthClientForUpdate(clientId)`, and then checks if the `verifiedStatus` is different from the current `verified` status of the client. If it is different, the method updates the `verified` status and other fields of the client.

However, this approach has a performance issue. Instead of fetching the entire entity, the method could have simply checked if the client exists using `oauthClientDao.exists(clientId)`, which would have returned a boolean value indicating whether the client exists or not. This would have avoided fetching the entire entity and would have been more efficient.

Therefore, the code issue of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" is present in this method.

} [/INST]  Yes, there is a code issue of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" in the `getReviewById` method.

The method fetches the whole `Review` entity by its ID, and then checks if it is present in the database. However, this approach is inefficient and can lead to performance issues, especially if the `Review` entity is large or if the database is large.

A better approach would be to use the `findById` method of the `ReviewRepository` to check if the `Review` entity exists in the database, without fetching the entire entity. This can be done by using the `Optional` type, as in the `isEmployeeExist` method, to check if the `Review` entity exists in the database.

Here's an example of how the `getReviewById` method could be rewritten to use the `findById` method of the `ReviewRepository` to check if the `Review` entity exists in the database:
```
public Review getReviewById(Long reviewId) {
    Optional<Review> review = reviewRepository.findById(reviewId);
    if (review.isPresent()) {
        return review.get();
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```
By using the `findById` method of the `ReviewRepository`, the method only fetches the `Review` entity if it exists in the database, which can improve performance and reduce the amount of data that needs to be fetched.

The issue is that the code is fetching the whole entity (TaskImpl) even though it only needs to check if the entity exists. This can result in unnecessary data transfer and increase the load on the database.

A better approach would be to use the `findById` method of the `EntityManager` to check if the entity exists without fetching the whole entity. For example:

public Task findTask(Long taskId) {
