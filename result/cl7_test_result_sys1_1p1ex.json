This can result in unnecessary data transfer and increase the load on the database.\n\nA better approach would be to use the `findById` method of the `EntityManager` to check if the entity exists without fetching the whole entity. For example:\n\npublic Task findTask(Long taskId) {\n    check();\n    return this.em.find(TaskImpl.class, taskId);\n}\n\nThis way, the code only fetches the ID of the entity, which is much more efficient than fetching the whole entity."}, "30": {"question_prompt": "<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant with a deep knowledge of code and software design.
