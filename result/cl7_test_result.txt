In the `TransportationService` class, the `checkIfTransportationExists` method fetches the whole entity using the `findById` method and then checks if the entity is null or not. This is not an issue of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" because the entity is not fetched only to check its existence. Instead, the entity is fetched and then checked for its existence.

In contrast, in the `EmployeeService` class, the `isEmployeeExist` method fetches the whole entity using the `findById` method and then checks if the entity is present or not. This is an issue of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" because the entity is fetched only to check its existence, and not to retrieve any other information about the entity.

In the `deleteById` method, the `findById` method is used to fetch the entity with the given `postId`. The `ifPresentOrElse` method is then used to check if the entity exists, and if it does, the `deleteById` method is called to delete the entity. If the entity does not exist, the `ifPresentOrElse` method will execute the `else` block, which throws a `ResponseStatusException` with a status code of `NOT_FOUND`.

The issue is that the code is fetching the whole entity (using `findById`) just to check if it exists. This is an inefficient approach, as it fetches the entire entity, which may not be necessary.

A better approach would be to use `existsById` instead of `findById`, which returns a boolean indicating whether the entity exists or not. This approach is more efficient, as it only fetches the necessary information to determine if the entity exists or not.

} [/INST]  No, there is no code issue of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" in the given code. The code is using the `findAllByGroupCode` method of the `AppGroupingRepository` to fetch all the entities with the given `groupCode`, and then checking if the list is empty or not. If the list is not empty, the first element is returned.

Therefore, the code is not fetching the whole entity only to check its existence, but rather fetching the entire list of entities and then checking if the list is empty or not.

The following code contaning a code issue of 'Fetch the whole entity only to check existence':
public class EmployeeService {
    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    public boolean isEmployeeExist(Long id) {
        Optional<Employee> employee = employeeRepository.findById(id);
        return employee.isPresent();
    }
}
According to the above example, answer the following question with only 'Yes' or 'No' - is there any code issue of 'Fetch the whole entity only to check existence' in the following codes?
private void getTaskListByPatientNric(TaskSearchDTO taskSearchDTO, List<Long> patientTaskIds) {
final Optional<CustomerDTO> customerOpt = customerService
.findByPersonRegistrationNo(taskSearchDTO.getPatientNric())

if (!customerOpt.isPresent() || null == customerOpt.get().getId()) {
throw new WorkflowException(ExceptionHandlingConstants.EXCEPTION_MSGKEY_WORKFLOW_PATIENT_NOT_FOUND,
new Object[] { taskSearchDTO.getPatientNric() }, null)
}
final Set<Long> customerIds = new HashSet<>()
if (!this.checkCustomerHasMergedPerson(customerOpt.get())) {
customerIds.add(customerOpt.get().getId())
} else {
final List<CustomerDTO> customerList = customerService
.findByMergedPersonId(customerOpt.get().getMergedPersonId())
customerList.forEach(cust -> customerIds.add(cust.getId()))
}
if (taskSearchDTO.isIncludeRelated() && taskSearchDTO.getRelatedCustIdList() != null) {
taskSearchDTO.getRelatedCustIdList().forEach(relatedCustId -> {
if (customerIds.stream().noneMatch(custId -> custId.longValue() == relatedCustId.longValue())) {
customerIds.add(relatedCustId)
}
})
}
patientTaskIds.addAll(getTaskListByCustomerIds(customerIds))
} [/INST]  No, there is no code issue of "Fetch the whole entity only to check existence" in the provided code. The code is using the `findById` method of the `EmployeeRepository` to fetch the employee entity by ID, and then checking if the entity is present using the `isPresent` method. This is a common and efficient way to check if an entity exists in a database.
